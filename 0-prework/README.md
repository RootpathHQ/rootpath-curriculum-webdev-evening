2. Sign up for a GitHub account.
3. Sign up for Slack (we'll send you an invite).
4. Sign up for [Medium](#medium) and follow some people.
5. Get a [Twitter](#twitter) account.
6. Sign up for [Pocket](#pocket)

## Developing the right mindset

To be a good software engineer, you need to be a [T-shaped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-shaped_skills) person, with a wide breadth of skills plus a specialism. Because of this, the course covers a lot of ground with limited contact time. Anything you can do to gain prior knowledge will help out enourmously.

As far as we're concerned, two of the most important traits for success in the tech industry are **[passion](http://bit.ly/l-passion)** and **[curiosity](http://rootpath.co/l-curiosity)**. We're hoping you're already passionate about tech, but having the curiosity to find out how and why things work might be something you need to dmaevelop.

## Finding things to read

This document provides a few starting points, but it's important that you learn to find interesting stuff through your own channels. Two good places to start are [Twitter](http://twitter.com) and [Medium](http://medium.com).

#### Medium 
1. **Set up an account** – You'll be using Medium to write and publish articles as the training progresses.
2. **Follow some people** – Follow tags, people and publications that align with your interests in technology. You could start with these:
    * [Technology](https://medium.com/tag/technology)
    * [Startup](https://medium.com/tag/startup)
    * [Ruby](https://medium.com/tag/ruby) (or whatever programming language you favour)
    * [DevOps](https://medium.com/tag/devops)
    * [Business](https://medium.com/tag/business)
    * [Innovation](https://medium.com/tag/innovation)
    * [FreeCodeCamp](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/)
    * [BackChannel](https://backchannel.com/)
    * [The Startup](https://medium.com/swlh)
    * [Personal Growth](https://medium.com/keep-learning-keep-growing)
    * [Medium Engineering](https://medium.engineering/)
    * [Several People are Typing](https://slack.engineering/)
    * [Rootpath](http://medium.com/rootpath)

3. **Get the app** – Install the Medium app on your phone. The bookmarks feature is useful.
4. **Write** – If you fancy it, write an article ✍️.

#### Twitter

Twitter is a brilliant place to find interesting and relevant articles, but only if you follow the right people. You could start by following Medium authors whose articles you've enjoyed, and build your list up by looking at the people they follow.

Feel free to share any good articles or videos you find with [@spartaglobal](http://twitter.com/rootpathHQ)!

#### Pocket

Once you start following enough people on Twitter, Medium, YouTube and the like, it's very easy to get overwhelmed with all the interesting content. Pocket allows you to save articles when you see them, to read them later.

1. Sign up for an account at http://getpocket.com.
2. Install the Browser extension.
3. Install the app on your phone.
4. Start saving and reading articles.

#### What to read?

Being a good technologist is about far more than writing good code: It's about understanding business, and being productive in every area of your life and work. While you should obviously read technical articles, don't discount articles on **business**, **personal productivity**, **habits**, **agile**, **process**, **teamwork**, **communication** and **management**. All these things are just as crucial to your career as your coding ability.

## Learning the basics

#### Markdown

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is a simple language which is used extensively in the tech world. The syntax is pretty simple, and we highly recommend that you [learn it](https://blog.ghost.org/markdown/) before joining the course. Here's a [good interactive tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

You'll be using markdown extensively, and many of us use it to write our notes. (In fact, this document is written in Markdown!) 

You should:

* Complete [this video course on Markdown](https://masteringmarkdown.com/).
* Complete [this interactive tutorial](http://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

#### The Command Line

You're going to spend a lot of time working with the command line. We recommend the following, before you start:

1. Complete free elements of the Codecademy *[Learn the Command Line Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line)* (3 hours).
2. Spend some time practising some of the basics. Command like `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `touch`, `ls` should be second nature to you. 


#### HTML & CSS

Codecademy's free *[HTML & CSS Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/web)* (7 hours) provides a free set of video lessons on building basic web pages. We'll cover this during the training, but it's a good idea to complete this course beforehand.
