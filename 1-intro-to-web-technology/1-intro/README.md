## Lesson & Course Structure

Each session will take approximately 1 hour. You should expect to spend **about half an hour** preparing for the session beforehand, and **between one and six hours** doing the post-session exercises and reading.

There are 42 sessions in total, so the whole course will take about 21 weeks (or 5 months), assuming 2 sessions per week. That said, this session is felxible, and depending how well you're getting on, we may be able to cover a number of sessions over a weekend.

Although there's osme felxibility, ideally we'll stick to a fixed cadance - every Monday and Thursday, for example.

* Pre-work (reading, setup, downloading starter code, videos)
